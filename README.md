# Friends
Those friends you have because they are stronger characters than you and you just can’t seem to pull away. They've always been there, your friends, it would be strange for them not to be.

Those friends you have that nag you about things you don't want to listen to but you do because they’ve always been your friends, it would be strange for them not to be.

Those friends who call you because they really just want to talk at you even though they ask you for advice, they only pretend to listen to you. But they're your friends, it would be strange for them not to be. 

Those friends you want to lean on but they never seem to be stable enough for you to lean on, so you’re always the one being leant on. You like to be needed so they’re your friends,it would be strange for them not to be.

Those friends who never remember what you do on a daily basis but always seem to remember the most important things so they redeem themselves in your mind. They're your friends, it would strange for them not to be. 

Those friends who have really bad habits but you can't be honest and point them out to them because they'll just become verbally aggressive. These friends scare you but you're friends because it would be strange for them not to be. 

Those friends you value, who tell you they value you too but the evidence is not there and you drift apart. You still end up calling them friends. They're your friends, it would be strange for them not to be. 

Those friends that think they don't deserve you because they mess up, but they just need someone, just like you need someone. So you're friends because it would be strange not to be.

Those friends who shouldn’t be friends but they are, not deeply, not in reality, because it's easy, because you’re lonely, because they’re lonely, because it's better to have someone than to have no one. They stay your friends, because it would be strange for them not to be.
